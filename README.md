# Books Lists w/ NextJs

Wanted to test the NextJs framework, mainly for
Static Site Generation.

## [Check out the project](https://bookstore-nextjs-test-4504a7svy-vpetridis.vercel.app/)

## Styling

I always wanted to check out the
[Ant-d](https://ant.design/) design system so I
gave it a few tries in this project.

## What's next?

In the
[About](https://bookstore-nextjs-test-4504a7svy-vpetridis.vercel.app/about)
page you may find my next steps for this project,
along with everything I have tried so far.

The final goal is to use NextJs with Strapi and
create simple News/Blogs pages with Server Side
Rendering.
